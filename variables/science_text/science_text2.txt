Title: Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotic resistance arises when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics that previously killed them or inhibited their growth. Resistance can occur through spontaneous genetic mutations or horizontal gene transfer, such as the exchange of plasmids carrying resistance genes. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture accelerates this process by applying selective pressure that favors resistant strains. As resistant bacteria proliferate, infections become harder to treat, requiring higher doses or alternative therapies. The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens poses a significant public health threat, prompting global efforts to develop new antibiotics and implement stewardship programs to curb misuse.
