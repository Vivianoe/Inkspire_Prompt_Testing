Title: Mechanisms of Plate Tectonics
The theory of plate tectonics describes the large-scale movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. These rigid plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere and interact at plate boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, mountain building, and volcanic activity. Convergent boundaries occur when plates collide, resulting in subduction zones or continental uplift. Divergent boundaries form where plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust at mid-ocean ridges. Transform boundaries involve plates sliding past each other horizontally, producing fault lines like Californiaâ€™s San Andreas Fault. Plate tectonics explains the distribution of continents, ocean basins, and the patterns of seismic activity observed worldwide.
