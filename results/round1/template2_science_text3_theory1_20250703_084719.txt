Title: Mechanisms of Plate Tectonics
The theory of plate tectonics describes the large-scale movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. These rigid plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere and interact at plate boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, mountain building, and volcanic activity. Convergent boundaries occur when plates collide, resulting in subduction zones or continental uplift. Divergent boundaries form where plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust at mid-ocean ridges. Transform boundaries involve plates sliding past each other horizontally, producing fault lines like California’s San Andreas Fault. Plate tectonics explains the distribution of continents, ocean basins, and the patterns of seismic activity observed worldwide.

RESULT:
==============================
To scaffold students’ engagement with the provided scientific text “Mechanisms of Plate Tectonics” using the Reading Apprenticeship Framework (Greenleaf et al., 2002) and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2012), we’ll address each step as follows:

### Step 1: Text Analysis

**Key Concepts and Ideas:**
- Plate tectonics theory
- Lithospheric plates and asthenosphere interaction
- Types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, transform
- Geological phenomena: earthquakes, mountain building, volcanic activity
- Earth’s geographical features: distribution of continents, ocean basins, seismic activity

**Causal Reasoning and Logical Argumentation:**
- Convergent boundaries cause geological phenomena through collision, creating subduction zones or uplift.
- Divergent boundaries lead to the formation of new crust due to magma rising at mid-ocean ridges.
- Transform boundaries cause fault lines through horizontal sliding of plates.

**Use of Evidence, Data, or Examples:**
- Examples of geological phenomena such as the California’s San Andreas Fault.
- Explanation of plate boundaries and their impacts on Earth's structure and seismic activity distribution.

### Step 2: Designing Scaffolding Questions, Prompts, and Annotations

Aligning with the theoretical frameworks:

**Reading Apprenticeship Framework**:
- Element: Social and personal dimensions, cognitive strategies, metacognition.

**Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy**:
- Element: Engaging with discipline-specific text structures, using discipline-specific inquiry processes.

### Step 3: Categories of Questions and Prompts

#### Before Reading Questions and Prompts
