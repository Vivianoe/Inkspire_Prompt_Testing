PROMPT:
==============================
You are an expert college science instructor with deep knowledge of the Reading Apprenticeship framework (Greenleaf et al., 2002) and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2012). Your goal is to create high-quality scaffolds to support students’ engagement with scientific texts.
Please complete the following tasks step by step:
Step 1: Carefully analyze the scientific text to:
Identify the key concepts and ideas.
Describe any causal reasoning or logical argumentation.
Highlight the use of evidence, data, or examples that support claims.
Step 2: Using insights from both the Reading Apprenticeship framework and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy, design scaffolding questions, prompts, and annotations. Ensure that each item clearly aligns with specific elements of these frameworks and supports disciplinary literacy development.
Step 3: Based on your analysis and theoretical alignment, generate three categories of questions and prompts. For each question, prompt, or annotation, clearly indicate which theoretical framework(s) and dimension(s) it corresponds to:
Before Reading Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 close reading questions designed to guide students’ overall purpose for reading and activate prior knowledge relevant to the text.
- 5 higher-order prompts that offer strategies to approach the reading critically and thoughtfully.
In-Text Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 annotations with embedded questions that anchor students in the text while prompting them to engage in science inquiry processes. For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related question.
- 5 annotations with embedded prompts that guide students to apply general reading strategies and science inquiry strategies while reading. For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related prompt.
After Reading Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 reflective questions to help students summarize, synthesize, and critically evaluate the reading.
- 5 reflective prompts offering guidance on how to reflect effectively and consolidate understanding.
Important: Make sure your output is organized clearly under each section and that all questions and prompts are specific, actionable, and explicitly connected to both theoretical frameworks.

Title: Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotic resistance arises when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics that previously killed them or inhibited their growth. Resistance can occur through spontaneous genetic mutations or horizontal gene transfer, such as the exchange of plasmids carrying resistance genes. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture accelerates this process by applying selective pressure that favors resistant strains. As resistant bacteria proliferate, infections become harder to treat, requiring higher doses or alternative therapies. The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens poses a significant public health threat, prompting global efforts to develop new antibiotics and implement stewardship programs to curb misuse.

RESULT:
==============================
Certainly! Below is an organized response that covers each of the requested steps, aligning with the Reading Apprenticeship framework by Greenleaf et al. (2002) and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy by Shanahan & Shanahan (2012).

---

### Step 1: Text Analysis

#### Key Concepts and Ideas
- Antibiotic resistance as a result of bacterial evolution.
- Mechanisms of resistance: genetic mutations and horizontal gene transfer.
- Impact of antibiotic misuse in medicine and agriculture.
- Consequences of resistance: harder-to-treat infections and the rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
- Importance of new antibiotic development and stewardship programs.

#### Causal Reasoning and Logical Argumentation
- Exposure to antibiotics creates selective pressure, favoring resistant strains.
- Misuse and overuse of antibiotics accelerate resistance development.
- As resistance grows, treatment requires alternative strategies, creating a public health threat.

#### Use of Evidence, Data, or Examples
- Mention of "spontaneous genetic mutations" and "horizontal gene transfer" as evidence of resistance mechanisms.
- Example of human activity as a factor: "widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics."

### Step 2: Scaffolding Design

#### Before Reading Questions and Prompts

##### Close Reading Questions
1. What do we already know about antibiotic usage in medicine and agriculture? (Related to prior knowledge activation - Reading Apprenticeship Framework)
2. How might bacteria adapt to environmental pressures, such as antibiotic exposure? (Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy - Prior knowledge in science inquiry)
3. Why is understanding antibiotic resistance important for public health? (Reading Apprenticeship Framework - Establish a purpose for reading)
4. Can you think of conditions that might promote or hinder bacterial evolution? (Higher-order scientific reasoning - Conceptual Framework)
5. What potential consequences can arise from not using antibiotics responsibly? (Reading Apprenticeship - Consequence Prediction)

##### Higher-Order Prompts
1. Before we read, consider the role of human behavior in natural selection. How might it affect the evolution of bacteria? (Critical thinking - Reading Apprenticeship)
2. When you read scientific texts, what strategies help you connect new information to what you already know? (Strategic reading approach - Reading Apprenticeship)
3. Consider the implications of antibiotic resistance at both an individual and societal level. (Higher-order analysis - Conceptual Framework)
4. Think about how scientists might gather data to study antibiotic resistance. (Scientific method connection - Conceptual Framework)
5. How do global coordination efforts, such as stewardship programs, influence scientific research? (Interdisciplinary understanding - Conceptual Framework)
