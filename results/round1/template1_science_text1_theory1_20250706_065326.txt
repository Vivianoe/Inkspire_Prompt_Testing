- 5 annotations with embedded prompts that guide students to apply general reading strategies and science inquiry strategies while reading. For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related prompt.
After Reading Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 reflective questions to help students summarize, synthesize, and critically evaluate the reading.
- 5 reflective prompts offering guidance on how to reflect effectively and consolidate understanding.
Important: Make sure your output is organized clearly under each section and that all questions and prompts are specific, actionable, and explicitly connected to both theoretical frameworks.
that prompts  that help students identify claims, mechanisms, and assumptions
Science Text:
""" Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
“Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. While visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the planet’s surface, the heat re-emitted by the Earth is partially absorbed and re-radiated by these gases in all directions. This process increases the average temperature of the lower atmosphere. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average surface temperature would be around –18°C rather than the current 15°C. However, the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities has enhanced this effect, leading to global warming.”

Follow the following theoretical frameworks:
