The Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2012)
Your goal is to generate high-quality questions, prompts, and annotations to scaffold students‚Äô engagement with scientific texts.
Please proceed step by step through the following tasks.
üü¢ Part 1: Carefully analyze the scientific text to:
Identify the key concepts and ideas.
Describe any causal reasoning or logical argumentation.
Highlight the use of evidence, data, or examples that support claims.
üü¢ Part 2: Reading Apprenticeship Framework
Step 1: Social Dimension
Analyze the text through the lens of the Social Dimension.
Generate questions that help create a safe and collaborative environment by encouraging students to share their reading processes, confusions, difficulties, problems, and solutions.
Step 2: Personal Dimension
Analyze the text through the lens of the Personal Dimension.
Generate prompts that help students develop and extend their identities and self-awareness as readers, clarify their purposes for reading, and articulate personal goals for improving their reading practices.

Generate prompts that encourage students to apply cognitive reading strategies, including:
Getting the big picture
Breaking down complex information
Setting reading purposes and adjusting reading processes
Monitoring comprehension
Using problem-solving strategies to repair misunderstandings
Step 4: Knowledge-Building Dimension

Step 6: Generate questions to help students reflect on the epistemology of science, including:
Developing inquiry dispositions
Cultivating conceptual change awareness
Recognizing science as a process for solving authentic problems
Tolerating ambiguity and seeking the best possible understanding given the evidence
Considering significance, relevance, and feasibility of inquiry
üü¢ Part 3: Organize Outputs into Three Categories

Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
‚ÄúGreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth‚Äôs surface. While visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the planet‚Äôs surface, the heat re-emitted by the Earth is partially absorbed and re-radiated by these gases in all directions. This process increases the average temperature of the lower atmosphere. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average surface temperature would be around ‚Äì18¬∞C rather than the current 15¬∞C. However, the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities has enhanced this effect, leading to global warming.‚Äù

RESULT:
==============================
## Part 1: Analysis of the Scientific Text

### Key Concepts and Ideas
- Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane) trap infrared radiation.
- These gases re-radiate heat in all directions.
- The natural greenhouse effect increases Earth's average temperature.
- Human activities are enhancing this effect, leading to global warming.

### Causal Reasoning and Logical Argumentation
- The text presents a causal relationship: greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation, raising atmospheric temperature.
- It contrasts natural versus human-enhanced greenhouse effects, implying negative consequences due to human activities.

### Use of Evidence, Data, or Examples
- Comparative temperature data: Without the natural greenhouse effect, the Earth‚Äôs temperature would be ‚Äì18¬∞C instead of 15¬∞C, providing evidence of the greenhouse effect‚Äôs significance.
- Mention of human activities increasing greenhouse gas concentrations as evidence for its enhancement and link to global warming.
