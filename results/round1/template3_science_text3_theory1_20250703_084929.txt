Science Text:

Title: Mechanisms of Plate Tectonics
The theory of plate tectonics describes the large-scale movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. These rigid plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere and interact at plate boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, mountain building, and volcanic activity. Convergent boundaries occur when plates collide, resulting in subduction zones or continental uplift. Divergent boundaries form where plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust at mid-ocean ridges. Transform boundaries involve plates sliding past each other horizontally, producing fault lines like Californiaâ€™s San Andreas Fault. Plate tectonics explains the distribution of continents, ocean basins, and the patterns of seismic activity observed worldwide.

RESULT:
==============================
To develop questions, prompts, and annotations that scaffold students' engagement with the scientific text on "Mechanisms of Plate Tectonics," let's proceed through the tasks step by step, utilizing both the Reading Apprenticeship framework and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy.

### Part 1: Analyzing the Scientific Text

#### Key Concepts and Ideas
- Large-scale movement of Earth's lithospheric plates.
- Interaction of plates at boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform.
- Geological phenomena: earthquakes, mountain building, volcanic activity.
- Plate tectonics' role in the distribution of continents, ocean basins, and seismic activity patterns.

#### Causal Reasoning and Logical Argumentation
- Movement of plates causes various geological phenomena.
- Convergent boundaries lead to subduction or uplift; divergent boundaries lead to new crust formation; transform boundaries lead to horizontal sliding and fault lines.
