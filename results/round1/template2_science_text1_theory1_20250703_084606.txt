PROMPT:
==============================
You are an expert college science instructor with deep knowledge of the Reading Apprenticeship framework (Greenleaf et al., 2002) and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2012). Your goal is to create high-quality scaffolds to support students’ engagement with scientific texts.
Please complete the following tasks step by step:
Step 1: Carefully analyze the scientific text to:
Identify the key concepts and ideas.
Describe any causal reasoning or logical argumentation.
Highlight the use of evidence, data, or examples that support claims.
Step 2: Using insights from both the Reading Apprenticeship framework and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy, design scaffolding questions, prompts, and annotations. Ensure that each item clearly aligns with specific elements of these frameworks and supports disciplinary literacy development.
Step 3: Based on your analysis and theoretical alignment, generate three categories of questions and prompts. For each question, prompt, or annotation, clearly indicate which theoretical framework(s) and dimension(s) it corresponds to:
Before Reading Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 close reading questions designed to guide students’ overall purpose for reading and activate prior knowledge relevant to the text.
- 5 higher-order prompts that offer strategies to approach the reading critically and thoughtfully.
In-Text Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 annotations with embedded questions that anchor students in the text while prompting them to engage in science inquiry processes. For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related question.
- 5 annotations with embedded prompts that guide students to apply general reading strategies and science inquiry strategies while reading. For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related prompt.
After Reading Questions and Prompts
Generate:
- 5 reflective questions to help students summarize, synthesize, and critically evaluate the reading.
- 5 reflective prompts offering guidance on how to reflect effectively and consolidate understanding.
Important: Make sure your output is organized clearly under each section and that all questions and prompts are specific, actionable, and explicitly connected to both theoretical frameworks.

Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
“Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. While visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the planet’s surface, the heat re-emitted by the Earth is partially absorbed and re-radiated by these gases in all directions. This process increases the average temperature of the lower atmosphere. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average surface temperature would be around –18°C rather than the current 15°C. However, the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities has enhanced this effect, leading to global warming.”

RESULT:
==============================
To effectively scaffold student engagement with the scientific text "Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect," we will use the Reading Apprenticeship framework and the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy to create targeted questions and prompts. These strategies will help students build disciplinary literacy by focusing on key scientific processes and concepts while developing metacognitive skills.

**Step 1: Analysis of Scientific Text**

1. **Key Concepts and Ideas:**
   - Greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane)
   - Infrared radiation trapping
   - Visible sunlight and Earth’s re-emission of heat
   - Natural greenhouse effect compared to anthropogenic global warming

2. **Causal Reasoning and Logical Argumentation:**
   - Explanation of how greenhouse gases trap heat, maintaining Earth’s temperature.
   - The role human activities play in increasing greenhouse gases, thereby enhancing the natural greenhouse effect.

3. **Evidence, Data, or Examples:**
   - Temperature comparison: Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's average would be –18°C versus the current 15°C.

**Step 2: Designing Scaffolding Questions, Prompts, and Annotations**

These are aligned with the theoretical frameworks to support students' understanding of disciplinary literacy.

**Step 3: Categories of Questions and Prompts**
