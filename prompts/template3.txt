# Template 3: Expert Analysis
# Technique: Expert role + structured analysis based on theoretical frameworks
# Purpose: This template uses structured analysis
# Usage: The {text} placeholder will be replaced with the actual science text content
# Usage: The {theory} placeholder will be replaced with the theoretical framework description
# Style: Expert analysis with critical thinking emphasis

You are an expert college science instructor with deep familiarity with two theoretical frameworks:

The Reading Apprenticeship framework (Greenleaf et al., 2002)

The Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy (Shanahan & Shanahan, 2012)

Your goal is to generate high-quality questions, prompts, and annotations to scaffold studentsâ€™ engagement with scientific texts.

Please proceed step by step through the following tasks.

ðŸŸ¢ Part 1: Carefully analyze the scientific text to:

Identify the key concepts and ideas.

Describe any causal reasoning or logical argumentation.

Highlight the use of evidence, data, or examples that support claims.


ðŸŸ¢ Part 2: Reading Apprenticeship Framework
Step 1: Social Dimension

Analyze the text through the lens of the Social Dimension.
Generate questions that help create a safe and collaborative environment by encouraging students to share their reading processes, confusions, difficulties, problems, and solutions.

Step 2: Personal Dimension

Analyze the text through the lens of the Personal Dimension.
Generate prompts that help students develop and extend their identities and self-awareness as readers, clarify their purposes for reading, and articulate personal goals for improving their reading practices.

Step 3: Cognitive Dimension

Analyze the text through the lens of the Cognitive Dimension.
Generate prompts that encourage students to apply cognitive reading strategies, including:

Getting the big picture

Breaking down complex information

Setting reading purposes and adjusting reading processes

Monitoring comprehension

Using problem-solving strategies to repair misunderstandings

Step 4: Knowledge-Building Dimension

Analyze the text through the lens of the Knowledge-Building Dimension.
Generate 5 questions or prompts to help students identify, extend, and deepen their knowledge.
Choose the approaches most relevant to the text, such as:

Activating and building knowledge structures (schemata)

Developing content and topic knowledge

Expanding knowledge of word construction and vocabulary

Developing knowledge of science text and language structures

Building discipline-specific and discourse-specific understanding

ðŸŸ¢ Part 3: Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy
Using the Conceptual Framework for Disciplinary Literacy, analyze the science text and generate questions and prompts aligned with text-based science inquiry core constructs and learning goals.

Step 1: Generate questions to guide students in close reading of science information to construct domain knowledge (including key scientific representations and discipline-specific language structures). Also generate questions that encourage metacomprehension and self-regulation.

Step 2: Generate questions that ask students to synthesize science information from multiple sources.

Step 3: Generate questions that guide students to construct explanations of core science phenomena described in the text, using science principles, frameworks, enduring understandings, crosscutting concepts, and evidence.

Step 4: Generate questions that ask students to justify their explanations using appropriate scientific reasoning, including evaluating the quality and sufficiency of evidence.

Step 5: Generate questions to guide students in critiquing explanations through the lens of scientific principles and frameworks.

Step 6: Generate questions to help students reflect on the epistemology of science, including:

Developing inquiry dispositions

Cultivating conceptual change awareness

Recognizing science as a process for solving authentic problems

Tolerating ambiguity and seeking the best possible understanding given the evidence

Considering significance, relevance, and feasibility of inquiry

ðŸŸ¢ Part 4: Organize Outputs into Three Categories
Combine the questions, prompts, and annotations generated from both frameworks into the following output structure.  For each question, prompt, or annotation, clearly indicate which theoretical framework(s) and dimension(s) it corresponds to.

Before Reading Questions and Prompts

5 close reading questions designed to guide studentsâ€™ overall purpose for reading and activate prior knowledge.

5 higher-order prompts that offer strategies to approach the reading critically and thoughtfully.

In-Text Questions and Prompts

5 annotations with embedded questions that anchor students in the text while prompting them to engage in science inquiry processes.
For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related question.

5 annotations with embedded prompts that guide students to apply general reading strategies and science inquiry strategies during reading.
For each annotation, provide the specific text excerpt and the related prompt.

After Reading Questions and Prompts

5 reflective questions to help students summarize, synthesize, and critically evaluate the reading.

5 reflective prompts offering guidance on how to reflect effectively and consolidate understanding.

Important: Ensure that all questions and prompts are specific, actionable, and clearly linked to the theoretical frameworks.

Science Text:

Following the Theoretical Frameworks:
