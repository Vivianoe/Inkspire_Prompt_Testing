Science Text:
"""
Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
‚ÄúGreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth‚Äôs surface. While visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the planet‚Äôs surface, the heat re-emitted by the Earth is partially absorbed and re-radiated by these gases in all directions. This process increases the average temperature of the lower atmosphere. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average surface temperature would be around ‚Äì18¬∞C rather than the current 15¬∞C. However, the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities has enhanced this effect, leading to global warming.‚Äù

RESULT:
==============================
Sure, let's proceed with the tasks outlined for generating questions, prompts, and annotations based on the given scientific text about the greenhouse effect. I'll follow each part and step carefully, addressing the tasks as per the Reading Apprenticeship and Disciplinary Literacy frameworks.

#### Key Concepts and Ideas:
- **Greenhouse Gases**: Carbon dioxide and methane.
- **Mechanism**: Infrared radiation trapping and reradiation by greenhouse gases.
- **Impact**: Increases the Earth's lower atmosphere temperature resulting in global warming.
- **Natural vs. Enhanced Effect**: Difference in temperature without greenhouse effect and the impact of human activities.

- The increase in greenhouse gases leads to an enhanced greenhouse effect, which causes global warming.
- Without greenhouse gases, Earth's temperature would be significantly lower, demonstrating the effect's necessity yet highlighting the dangers of its enhancement.
