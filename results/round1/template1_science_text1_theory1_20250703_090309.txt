Science Text:
""" Title: Mechanism of the Greenhouse Effect
“Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. While visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the planet’s surface, the heat re-emitted by the Earth is partially absorbed and re-radiated by these gases in all directions. This process increases the average temperature of the lower atmosphere. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average surface temperature would be around –18°C rather than the current 15°C. However, the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities has enhanced this effect, leading to global warming.”

Follow the following theoretical frameworks:
